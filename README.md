# Gulp Starter Kit
This repo aims to reduce the tedium of crafting gulp tasks on a new project.

### Tasks
- ```gulp connect``` - runs a webserver at ```http://localhost```. Run with ```sudo``` for port 80, otherwise change it something else.
- ```gulp``` - runs ```dev``` and then ```watch``` tasks. Builds JS and CSS.
